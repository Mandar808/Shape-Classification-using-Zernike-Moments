# ðŸ”  Capital Alphabet Recognition using Zernike Moments and SVM

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to recognize **capital English alphabets (Aâ€“Z)** using **Zernike Moments** for shape-based feature extraction and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification.

Zernike Moments are rotation-invariant features ideal for recognizing shapes and characters from images, making them a great choice for printed alphabet recognition.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- âœ… Balanced dataset of capital letters (Aâ€“Z) with synthetic grayscale images.
- âœ… Feature extraction using Zernike Moments from the `pyfeats` library.
- âœ… Classification using an SVM model trained on extracted features.
- âœ… Achieves **100% accuracy** on test data.
- âœ… Model and label encoder are saved for deployment or further use.
